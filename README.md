# music-recommendation-system
## 🧠 Conclusion

- This project explored multiple recommendation techniques:
  - **Popularity-based filtering**: Suggests globally popular tracks
  - **Item-similarity-based filtering**: Recommends songs similar to the ones a user likes
  - **Year-filtered popularity**: Enhances recommendations by incorporating temporal relevance

- These methods lay the groundwork for a more advanced recommender system.
- Future improvements could include:
  - **Content-based filtering** using metadata (genre, artist, tempo, etc.)
  - **User profiling** and hybrid models to improve personalization
